# Basic_Shape_Detection
Shape detection using feed forward nerual net and bootstrapped shapes generated in numpy
based on the [Medium post](https://towardsdatascience.com/object-detection-with-neural-networks-a4e2c46b4491) 
and code.  Modified for hollow rectangles (as opposed to filled). 

First step to training a neural net to recongnize basic shapes in a flow sheet.

Next steps:
* multiple rectangle detection
* use of CNN's
* transfer learning using YOLO V5
